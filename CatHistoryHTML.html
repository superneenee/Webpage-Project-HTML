<h1>Egypt</h1>
<p>Cats are not just a beloved pet in today's day and age but all throughout history have been loved animals. This is especially true in terms of ancient Egypt, when pharaohs ruled and pyramids were built.</p>

<p>Cats played a central role in the daily life and religious practices of ancient Egyptians. They kept their humans safe from snakes and scorpions and Egypt's grain supply safe from rats and mice. Cats even came to represent in animal form some of Egypt's most important gods.</p>

<p>Bastet is probably the best-known feline goddess from Egypt. Initially depicted as a lioness, Bastet assumed the image of a cat or a feline-headed woman in the 2nd millennium BCE. Although she combined both nurturing and violent qualities, her shielding and motherly aspects typically were emphasised. Countless representations of a seated cat, cat-headed goddess or cat with kittens include dedicatory inscriptions addressed to Bastet. By offering such inscribed images, donors expressed their wishes for health and children or, more generally, life and protection.</p>

<p class = "p2">Cats were so important to ancient Egyptians that to honour these treasured pets, wealthy families dressed them in jewels and fed them treats fit for royalty. When the cats died, they were mummified just like royalty and when their owner died, their cat was moved to be in the same tomb so the pair could remain together in the Afterlife. As a sign of mourning, cat owners would shave off their eyebrows, and would continue to mourn until their eyebrows grew back. (As a cat owner myself this seems like a realistic thing to do).</p>

<p class = "p2">Art from ancient Egypt shows statues and paintings of every type of feline. Cats were even so special that those who killed them, even by accident, were sentenced to death.</p>
