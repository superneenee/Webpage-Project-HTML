  <h1>Celebritys in the cat world</h1>
  <p>There are many famous cats all around the world!</p>
  <p>These cats are even seen as actual celebritys - all because of their adorable faces and funny personalities!</p>

  <h2>Tardar Sauce – Grumpy Cat</h2>
  <p>Grumpy Cat is quite possibly one of the most famous cats in history. She rose to fame in 2012 after a post of her
    face went viral on Reddit – at first, no-one believed her face hadn’t been altered but in truth her grumpy markings
    were real. And soon everyone fell in love. Despite her grumpy face, her parents assured us she is a very happy cat!
  </p>

  <h2>Lil Bub – the perma-kitten</h2>
  <p>Everyone’s heard of this adorable famous cat. She had a permanent kitten-like appearance which was due to a variety
    of genetic mutations, including teeth that never grew (which is why her tongue hung out of her mouth) and a type of
    dwarfism. Additionally, she also had a rare bone disorder known as Osteopetrosis and Lil Bub was the only cat in
    history known to be born with this. Unfortunately she is not with us anymore and passed away in late 2019.</p>

  <h2>A Street Cat Named Bob</h2>
  <p>Bob is a famous cat who started off living rough but then soon turned his and his owner’s lives around. James Bowen
    was a former drug addict and homeless man. But when Bob strolled into his home with an infected leg wound and chirpy
    personality, he gave James a new reason to live and the pair became inseparable. So much so, that Bob would join him
    whilst he busked throughout London, gaining the attention of both tourists and locals alike. The pair’s story is so
    captivating that it’s been turned into a book and then a film adaptation – in which Bob starred as himself.</p>

  <h2>Nala – The world’s most followed cat</h2>
  <p>This cross-eyed cutie is one of the most famous cats on the internet. Currently the Guinness World Record Holder
    for the most followers for a cat on Instagram. Nala currently has over 4 million fans and her own merch! Life wasnt
    always like this for Nala, she used to live in a shelter. But after she got adopted, with a little bit of medicine
    and care shes grown into the adorable cat loved by all!</p>
