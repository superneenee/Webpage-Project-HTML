    <p>Grumpy Cat is quite possibly one of the most famous cats in history. She rose to fame in 2012 after a post of her
      face went viral on Reddit – at first, no-one believed her face hadn’t been altered but in truth her grumpy
      markings
      were real. And soon everyone fell in love. Despite her grumpy face, her parents assured us she is a very happy
      cat!

    <p>Everyone’s heard of this adorable famous cat. She had a permanent kitten-like appearance which was due to a
      variety
      of genetic mutations, including teeth that never grew (which is why her tongue hung out of her mouth) and a type
      of
      dwarfism. Additionally, she also had a rare bone disorder known as Osteopetrosis and Lil Bub was the only cat in
      history known to be born with this. Unfortunately she is not with us anymore and passed away in late 2019.</p>

    <p>Bob is a famous cat who started off living rough but then soon turned his and his owner’s lives around. James
      Bowen
      was a former drug addict and homeless man. But when Bob strolled into his home with an infected leg wound and
      chirpy
      personality, he gave James a new reason to live and the pair became inseparable. So much so, that Bob would join
      him
      whilst he busked throughout London, gaining the attention of both tourists and locals alike. The pair’s story is
      so
      captivating that it’s been turned into a book and then a film adaptation – in which Bob starred as himself.</p>
